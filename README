This program uses fuse (Filesystem in user space) application. The purpose of
this program is to create a distributed filesystem which has a master and
multiple servers and clients. It has the added support failover if the master 
fails and high availability.

This project was developed with Avinash as an academic project.

Read about the assumptions we have made in the pdf file.


STEPS TO RUN
-------------

1. Start the master
./dfsmaster master_port_no
Eg:
./dfsmaster 12345

2. Start the server
./dfsserver server_port master_hostname master_port <remote-username> <server_rootdir>
Eg:
./dfsserver 20000 master_hostname 12345

<remote-username> and <rootdir> should only be used to test multiple servers after establishing ssh authentication without password prompt with the necessary public-private key pairs

3. Start the client
./dfsclient local_mountpoint server_rootdir master_hostname master_port

4. Running Postmark
a) compile and run postmark program

b) At the prompt set the location to mountpoint as below
set location mountpoint

c) set to unbuffered mode
set buffering false

d) run
